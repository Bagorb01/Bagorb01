# 👋 Hi, I'm Brooke

I'm a senior software engineer who loves thoughtful systems, user-centered design, and obsessively organizing ideas until they make sense.

But instead of reading a wall of text about me...  

🖥️ **Run this in your terminal instead:**

```bash
npx bxash-brookeos
```

BrookeOS is a command-line introduction —
a structured way to explore how I work, what I value, and what I’m into right now.

## 🧠 A few things I value
- Human-centered problem solving
- Clear communication
- Debugging as a collaborative sport
- Tools that help teams think better
- Visual systems for complex ideas
